    2. (Optional) Install a Java build tool.
    
    3. Install Node.js from the Node.js website. This will also install npm, which is the node package manager we are using in the next commands.

    - [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
       Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
       
    - npm install -g grunt-cli
    
    - Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
    auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.
    
        mvn
        grunt
       
    - Bower is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
      specifying a newer version in `bower.json`. You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
      Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.
